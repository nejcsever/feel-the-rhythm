* Notes and pauses are inserted by pressing/dragging on empty stave.
* Notes and pauses have different lengths and can also be deleted.
* Inserted notes are played when "Play" button is pressed.
* "Replay" button repeats MIDI melody that needs to be transformed into notes.
* When you think you've correctly placed all the notes, press "I'm done" button" and your score will be revealed to you. Mistakes are marked with red squares.
* Have fun!
